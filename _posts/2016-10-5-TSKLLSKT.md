## 第一章: Helping Children Deal with Their Feelings

1. Listen with full attention.  
   * It's much easier to tell your troubles to a parent who is really listening
   * Sometimes a sympathetic **silence** is all a child needs.
   * It's hard for a child to think clearly or constructively when someone is questioning, blaming, or advising her.  
2. Acknowledge with a word *Oh* *mmm* ... *I see*   
   * There's a lot of help to be had from a simple *Oh*  *mmm* or *I see*. Words like this, coupled with a caring attitude, are invitations to a child to explore her own thoughts and feelings, and possible come up with **her own solutions** , INSTEAD OF DENYING THE FEELING
3. Give the feeling a name.
   * Parents doesn't usually give this kind of response, because they fear that by giving a name to the feeling they'll make it worse. Just the opposite is true, The child who hears the words for what she is experiencing is deeply conforted. Someone has acknowledged her inner experience, INSTEAD OF EXPLANATION AND LOGIC. 
   * When children want something they can't have, adults usually respond with logical explanations of why they can't have it. Often, the harder we explain, the harder they protest.
4. Give a child his wishes in fantasy
   * Sometimes just having someone understand how much  you want something makes reality easier to bear

But more important than any words we use is our attitude. If our attitude is not one of compassion, then whatever we say will be experienced by the child as phony or manipulative. It is when our words are infused with our real feelings of empathy that they speak directly to a child’s heart. Of the four skills you’ve just seen illustrated, perhaps the most difficult is to have to listen to a child’s emotional outpourings and then “give a name to the feeling.” It takes practice and concentration to be able to look into and beyond what a child says in order to identify what he or she might be feeling. Yet it’s important that we give our children a vocabulary for their inner reality. Once they have the words for what they’re experiencing, they can begin to help themselves.
