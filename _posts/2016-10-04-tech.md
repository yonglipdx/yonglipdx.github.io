   - Array of unique_ptr

1. class member initialize  
        typedef struct testStruct{
         int a;
        } struct_a, *struct_a_p;

         int b = 2;
         string h = "text1";
         string s = "text2";
        }

1. prefer auto in the following case
        //Here is T in the expression. No need to repeat it again.
        auto p = new T();
        auto p = make_shared<T>(arg1);

        //If you need to store lambda you may use auto or std::function
        auto my_lambda = [](){};

        //Instead of: map<string,list<int>::iterator>::const_iterator it = m.cbegin(); 
        auto it = m.begin();

1. Range for/begin/end
        vector<int> v;
        for( auto d : v )
           total += d;
        int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
        sort( begin(a), end(a) );

1. LC errors
               auto i = unordered_map_xx.find("xx");
               **i->first**, **i->send**

               vector<int> v;
               v.pop_back() -> remove last element.
               v.erase(v.begin()) -> remove first element

               string s;
               s.find(str, start_pos), NOT s.find(start_pos, str);

# Lex
	Scanner produces a stream of tokens from the input source.
	lex is a scanner generator.
	lex input is set of regular expressions and associated action (wirtten in C)
	lex output is a table-driven scanner (lex.yy.c)
	flex: an open source implementation of lex.

	# lex input
		first part (optional)
		table size demision
		defination of text replacement
		global C code (specail syntax required)
		...
		%% -----> termination of FIRST PART
		pattern	action
		regular expression and action
		action and be C statment or block of C code.
		...
	 	%% ------> termination of SECOND PARt
		Third PART (optional)
		C code simplied used as is.

	Example: filename: exl.l
	--------
	%%
	"hello world"	printf("goodbye\n");
	.		;  ----> ignore everthing other than "hello world"
	%%
	--------

	lex exl.1 ----> generate a scanner, saved as lex.yy.c
	cc lex.yy.c -ll  (with -ll option main() is grab from the lex library)


	Example2: suppose we have configuration file "config.in"

# MISCELLANEOUS
  ## char* const vs    const char*
            according to the standard, const modifies the element directly to its left. 
            The use of const at the beginning of a declaration is just a convenient mental shortcut. 
            So the following two statements are equivalent:
            char const * pointerToConstantContent1;
            const char * pointerToConstantContent2;

            In order to ensure the pointer itself is not modified, 
            const should be placed after the asterisk:
            char * const constantPointerToMutableContent;

            To protect both the pointer and the content to which it points, use two consts.
            char const * const constantPointerToConstantContent;

## stringstream:
	example1: 
	  string a("123");
          stringstream ss(a);
	  ss << "456"
	  cout << aa.str(); ---> 456

        example2:
	  string a("123");
          stringstream ss("");
	  ss << a << << "456"
	  cout << aa.str(); ---> 123456

## ssize_t size_t
        to avoid i == -1

        size_t i: 
                 if (i > -1) // not OK since i always > -1
                 use i< (size_t)-1  to make sure i > -1;

        ssize_t i: 
		 i > -1 is OK since i could be -1 in ssize_t

			vector<int> v;
			for( auto d : v )
			   total += d;

			int a[] = {1,2,3,4,5};
			sort( begin(a), end(a) );


### cscope
   * Tip
      * tprev - Jump to the previous matching tag 
      * tlast - Jump to the last matching tag 
      * tfirst - Jump to the first matching tag 
      * tselect - Display a list of all the matching tags and jump to the selected tag 


### LC gas station problem
From starting point draw sum of (gas - distance).
At the end, if sum < 0, no solution and $urn -1.  

otherwise find the minimum station i and $urn i+1.

## Leadership principle

  * **Customer Obsession**
    * Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

  * **Ownership**
    * Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say "that’s not my job". 

  * **Invent and Simplify**
    * Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

  * **"Are Right, A Lot"**
    **Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

  * **Learn and Be Curious**
    * Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

  * **Hire and Develop The Best**
    ** Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others.  We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

  * **Insist on the Highest Standards
    * Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

  * **Think Big**
    * Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

  * *Bias for Action**
    * Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking. 

  * **Frugality**
    * Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention.  There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.

  * **Earn Trust**
    * Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.  Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume.  They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.


  * **Dive Deep**
    * Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

  * **Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit**
    * Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

  * **Deliver Results**
    * Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
